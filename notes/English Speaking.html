                                        Vowels are speech sounds produced without any significant constriction or blockage of airflow in the vocal tract. They are essential for forming the core of syllables and words in English.

                                        There are 22 vowel sounds in English, which can be categorized into:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>short vowels (e.g., /ɪ/ as in "bit")</li>
                                            <li>long vowels (e.g., /iː/ as in "see")</li>
                                            <li>diphthongs (e.g., /aɪ/ as in "my")</li>
                                    </details>
                                </li>
                                <li>consonants-left (e.g., /b/ as in "bat")
                                    <details>
                                        <summary>Description</summary>
                                        Consonants are speech sounds produced by partially or completely obstructing the airflow in the vocal tract. They work together with vowels to form words and give structure to spoken English.

                                        there are 24 consonant sounds in English, which can be categorized into:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>voiced consonants (e.g., /b/ as in "bat")</li>
                                            <li>voiceless consonants (e.g., /p/ as in "pat")</li>
                                            <li>nasal consonants (e.g., /m)
                                    </details>
                                </li>

                                semi-vowels (e.g., /j/ as in "yes")
                                    <details>
                                        <summary>Description</summary>
                                        Semi-vowels are sounds that have characteristics of both vowels and consonants. They are produced with a relatively open vocal tract, similar to vowels, but they function as consonants in syllable structure.

                                        There are two semi-vowel sounds in English:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>/j/ as in "yes"</li>
                                            <li>/w/ as in "we"</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </details>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
